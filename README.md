### Vercel Link: https://expense-tracker-app-three-beryl.vercel.app/

## Project Description:

Objective: Create an application that allows users to track their daily expenses.
Details: Use MongoDB for storing expense data, Express.js for server-side logic,
React.js for the front-end, and Node.js for backend operations. Include features
like adding, editing, and categorizing expenses.

## Technical Architecture:

- Frontend:

    Utilize React.js for building the user interface, tsparticle library for awesome background effect and used other libraries like unique-names-generator, react-datepicker, moment

    Implement responsive design using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Material-Icons.

- Backend:

    Use Node.js and Express.js to build a RESTful API for handling client requests and serving as the application's backend.

    Implement authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and middleware to protect endpoints.

- Database:

    Store all data, including user information, expense entries, and categories, in MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

    Implement Mongoose ORM for schema definition and validation.

- Deployment:

    Deploy the application to a cloud provider like AWS and render.
    frontend has deployed on AWS and backend on Render.

    Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
